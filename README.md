# dot_files
_GitHub repo created 161123_

My dot files.
They are still work in progress, but pretty much usable in (my) production and home environment.

- [x] vim.rc (init.vim also)
- [x] tmux.conf
- [ ] zsh.rc (old as Jeebus' donkey)
- [x] vimperatorrc

**TODO**
- [ ] mplayer.conf
- [ ] system files (FreeBSD and Linux)
- [ ] various /opt and ~/.opt scripts
- [ ] xmodmap
- [ ] probably much more

Please note that this is still work in progress and that untranslated parts and non-PC language are more than likely.
